# API Key
To use our API you will need to get an API key. To get your API key, simply send a direct message to **@harys722** in Discord or either send an email to [contact@harys.is-a.dev](mailto:contact@harys.is-a.dev). If you don't want to get your own API key and skip all these tedious processes, just use the public API provided by us.

### Public API Key
Here is the public API key that you can use while sending the request to our endpoints.

## Usage of API Key
You must include your API key in every request you make to our service by adding it to the **Authorization header**. This ensures that your requests are authenticated and processed by us.

> [!NOTE]
> The following key and value will go to the HTTP header.

| Key  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Authorization  | Your own personal API key that you've requested. |
